# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

A complete machine learning project to predict customer churn based on telco user behavior using Python and Scikit-learn. This project is designed for real-world business insight and predictive analysis.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- Trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict churn (Yes/No)
- Cleaned and encoded raw Telco data
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Took interactive user input to predict new churn outcomes
- Evaluated the model with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
- Exported model for production use

## 📁 Files Included

- `churn_prediction_model.ipynb`: Complete Jupyter notebook with code, visualizations, and explanations
- `Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`: Dataset used for training

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## 🧪 Model Accuracy

- Accuracy: **~80%**
- Classifier: Random Forest
- Evaluation Metrics: Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

## 📌 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
