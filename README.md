# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

A complete end-to-end **machine learning project** to predict telecom customer churn based on user behavior using Python and Scikit-learn. Designed for real-world **business insight**, **interactive prediction**, and **data-driven decision making**.

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights

✅ Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict churn (Yes/No)  
✅ Cleaned and encoded raw Telco data  
✅ Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
✅ Took **interactive user input** to predict new churn outcomes  
✅ Evaluated the model using **accuracy**, **classification report**, and **confusion matrix**  
✅ Exported the model using `joblib` for production use  
✅ Built a **Streamlit Dashboard** for live prediction and data visualization
